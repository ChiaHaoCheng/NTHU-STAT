# GMM
R package of multivariate-type Gaussian Mixture Models

This is my semester final project of STAT533000 Statistical Computing course at Inst. of Statistics, NTHU.  
If you want to use this package, you can directly install **emGMM_3.6.2.tar.gz** and load it into R.

## R fold.
  This fold stores related R programs that implement GMM. Please click on this file to view how to implement it.
  The enclosed includes:  
    em_GMM.R : Implementing GMM in R.  
    optimal_k.R : Searching for the optimal cluster number k.  
    plot_GMM.R: Visualizing GMM by pairs panel.
    other xxx.R : Load data set xxx by implementing "data( xxx )"  
    
## data fold.
  The data sets required to implement "data( xxx )".

## man fold.
  The required documents is to describe the details of R programs in R fold. For example, when implenmenting "help(xxx)" in R studio, the details for em_GMM will be accessed to the documentation pages for xxx, which xxx indicates R functions, data sets, and other objects.
